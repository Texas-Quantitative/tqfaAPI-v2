# [PROJECT NAME] - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
[Brief description of the project, tech stack, and architecture]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Project Infrastructure Documentation
**BEFORE making any infrastructure/deployment changes, ALWAYS:**

1. **Read the Documentation Maintenance Protocol**: Check `docs/DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE_PROTOCOL.md` - PREVENTS RESOURCE CONFUSION
2. **Read the Infrastructure Guide**: Check `docs/INFRASTRUCTURE_AND_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for current state
3. **Review Architectural Decisions**: Check `docs/ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md` for design patterns
4. **Use Quick Reference**: See `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for common tasks and troubleshooting
5. **Update Documentation**: If you make infrastructure changes, update the guides
6. **Cross-Reference Resources**: Verify resource relationships and dependencies
7. **Test Changes**: Always test after infrastructure modifications

**üî• CRITICAL CONTEXT - Environment Anomalies:**
- [List any environment-specific naming or configuration differences]
- [Document any historical decisions that differ from standards]
- **NEVER** summarize these as "minor differences" - they're critical infrastructure context!

**Common Issues to Avoid:**
- [Project-specific anti-patterns]
- [Common deployment pitfalls]
- [Security vulnerabilities to watch for]
- [Resource configuration mistakes]
- Losing critical context in conversation summaries

## üìñ README Template Addition

Add this section to your `README.md`:

```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Infrastructure Documentation**

**üìã Documentation Protocol**: READ [`docs/DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE_PROTOCOL.md`](./docs/DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE_PROTOCOL.md) FIRST

**üîç Before infrastructure changes:** Read [`docs/INFRASTRUCTURE_AND_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`](./docs/INFRASTRUCTURE_AND_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)

**üèóÔ∏è Before architectural changes:** Read [`docs/ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md)

## üöÄ Implementation Checklist

To implement this framework in a new project:

- [ ] Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with project-specific content
- [ ] Create `docs/` folder with all template files
- [ ] Customize templates with your project's specifics
- [ ] Add infrastructure documentation requirements to README
- [ ] Set up VS Code settings for consistency reminders
- [ ] Train team/agents on documentation maintenance protocol
- [ ] Establish regular documentation review cycle

---

## üéØ Customization Guide

**For each new project, customize:**

1. **Technology Stack**: Replace [PROJECT TYPE] with your stack (FastAPI, React, etc.)
2. **Infrastructure Types**: Replace Azure resources with your cloud provider
3. **Environment Names**: Update DEV/UAT/PROD to match your environments
4. **Common Issues**: Document your project's specific pitfalls
5. **Anti-Patterns**: List your domain-specific things to avoid
6. **Commands**: Replace example commands with your project's tools

**Key Success Factors:**
- Be specific, not generic
- Document the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what"
- Include exact resource names and configurations
- Update immediately when changes occur
- Never lose historical context in summaries

**üí° This framework prevents the architectural drift, resource confusion, and context loss that plague multi-agent development projects. Adapt it to your specific needs and maintain it religiously!**
