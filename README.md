```## Local Development



### **Current V2 Foundation**For developers who want to run the application locally or customize the agent:



The V2 project currently provides a **working FastAPI foundation** with:- **[Local Development Guide](./docs/local_development.md)** - Set up a local development environment, customize the frontend (starting with AgentPreview.tsx), modify agent instructions and tools, and use evaluation to improve your code.



- **Core API Structure**: Professional FastAPI application with proper middlewareThis guide covers:

- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health check endpoints- Environment setup and prerequisites

- **Version Management**: Automated version tracking and deployment pipeline- Running the development server locally

- **Interactive Documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI docs at `/docs`- Frontend customization and backend communication

- **Production Architecture**: Ready for Azure Container Apps deployment- Agent instructions and tools modification

- File management and agent recreation

### **Next Phase: TQFA Business Logic**- Using agent evaluation for code improvement



The current foundation uses placeholder content from "get-started-with-ai-agents" template. The next development phase focuses on adding actual TQFA (Texas Quantitative Financial Analysis) business logic to replace placeholders.

## Resource Clean-up

## üõ†Ô∏è **Development Workflow**

To prevent incurring unnecessary charges, it's important to clean up your Azure resources after completing your work with the application.

### **Local Development (Daily Work - 80%)**

- **When to Clean Up:**

Perfect for rapid feature development and debugging:  - After you have finished testing or demonstrating the application.

  - If the application is no longer needed or you have transitioned to a different project or environment.

```bash  - When you have completed development and are ready to decommission the application.

# Start development server with hot reload

uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host localhost --port 8000- **Deleting Resources:**

  To delete all associated resources and shut down the application, execute the following command:

# Development endpoints  

http://localhost:8000           # API information    ```bash

http://localhost:8000/health    # Health status      azd down

http://localhost:8000/docs      # Interactive API docs    ```

http://localhost:8000/redoc     # Alternative documentation

```    Please note that this process may take up to 20 minutes to complete.



**Benefits:**‚ö†Ô∏è Alternatively, you can delete the resource group directly from the Azure Portal to clean up resources.

### **Container Deployment (Integration - 20%)**Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.

The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers.

Used for Azure AI integration and production deployment:

You can try the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) for the resources:

```bash

# MANDATORY: Version bump before deployment- **Azure AI Foundry**: Free tier. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ai-studio/)  

python bump_version.py- **Azure Storage Account**: Standard tier, LRS. Pricing is based on storage and operations. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/)  

- **Azure AI Services**: S0 tier, defaults to gpt-4o-mini. Pricing is based on token count. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/)  

# Commit and deploy- **Azure Container App**: Consumption tier with 0.5 CPU, 1GiB memory/storage. Pricing is based on resource allocation, and each month allows for a certain amount of free usage. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-apps/)  

git add .- **Log analytics**: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)  

git commit -m "Version bump to X.Y.Z - [feature description]"- **Agent Evaluations**: Incurs the cost of your provided model deployment used for local evaluations.  

git push- **AI Red Teaming Agent**: Leverages Azure AI Risk and Safety Evaluations to assess attack success from the automated AI red teaming scan. Users are billed based on the consumption of Risk and Safety Evaluations as listed in [our Azure pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ai-foundry/). Click on the tab labeled ‚ÄúComplete AI Toolchain‚Äù to view the pricing details.



# Monitor deployment‚ö†Ô∏è To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,

gh run list --branch main --limit 3either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

gh run watch [RUN_ID]
